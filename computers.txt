Computers

History
- The word "computer" was first used in 1613, back then it was used to describe a person that did calculations and computations. The definition stayed the same until the end of the 19th century = 1800 - mid 20th century, then it became more similar to what we know today, machine that carries out computations.

- There has been many different types of computers and due to the change in definition and the meaning of computer its hard to specify what was actually the first computer. But in early 19th century (again 1800) Charles Baggage, has been called the father of Computers, came up with the Difference Engine and then in 1933 he came up with a more general solution the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine used punch cards as input and could print the result or punch it onto new cards that could be used in later calculations. These computers was used to co hardcore calculations and computations, aka crunching numbers!
A cool fun fact is that Baggage had help form Augusta Ada Byron who was a mathematician and is by some referred to as the worlds first computer programer.
Also the work of Baggage and Byron was not appreciated and disappeared after Baggage death in 1871 but luckily it got rediscovered in his notebooks in 1930 an they got the appreciation they deserved, but by then everything had already been reinvented by someone else.

Lets skip ahead a bit to under stand the computer we have today
- Modern computers is, very simply put, a machine that can take input, process it and provide an output. Earlier computers were used for the purpose to compute or calculate while the modern once can process the data it is given and it is programmable, we can program how to process the data

How do they work
- A computer is an electronic machine that processes information — in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end - this is the input, stores it until it's ready to work on it - this is memory, it process it for a bit - this id processing, then spits out the results at the other end - this is the output.
An example,

- Software
 A computer program is a sequence of instructions the computer can execute on its own.
 Today, computers work on a much wider variety of problems—but they are all still, essentially, calculations. Everything a computer does, from helping you to edit a photograph you've taken with a digital camera to displaying a web page, involves manipulating numbers in one way or another.

 An example, say you open a picture in a what ever program you open pictures in - but I guess everyone has heard about paint - so I open a picture in paint then I want to rotate the rotate the image 90 degrees. In this scenario the picture would be the input, then the picture would be stored on the memory by the program while it waits for instructions, rotating the image is the process and as most know an image contains of pixels, the computer stores each pixel as a number so when you want to rotate the picture the computer calculates the new values for each pixel.

 What makes a computer different from a calculator is that it can work all by itself. You just give it your instructions (called a program) and off it goes, performing a long and complex series of operations all by itself. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, if you wanted a home computer to do almost anything at all, you had to write your own little program to do it. For example, before you could write a letter on a computer, you had to write a program that would read the letters you typed on the keyboard, store them in the memory, and display them on the screen. Writing the program usually took more time than doing whatever it was that you had originally wanted to do (writing the letter). Pretty soon, people started selling programs like word processors to save you the need to write programs yourself.

 These programs are what we call software, they are not fixed since we can change it with programing
- Hardware
 On the other hand, a computer's hardware—the bits and pieces from which it is made and this is is pretty much fixed when you buy it off the shelf. The hardware is what makes your computer powerful; the ability to run different software is what makes it flexible.
